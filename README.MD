# Spotify Automation
The idea is simple -- enable global shortcuts to control Spotify
      
Imagine you are listening to some track recommended by Spotify while working on something else (say brwosing with Chrome). Suddenly you find the track very cool and want to save it, what would you do?     
-- Switch to Spotify app and click add to playlist XXX / drag track to playlist XXX ?     
-- Or simply just click a shortcut?    

With the power of AppleScript and Automator on OSX, we are able to implement this and similar global control over spotify automation
